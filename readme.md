# Responsive Homepage with Animation and Theme Toggle

This repository contains my solution to the fifth challenge from [DevChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io) - creating a responsive homepage with HTML and CSS. The page features animations on load and a theme toggle between light and dark modes. This challenge was a great way to improve my skills in building responsive web pages and implementing animations and theme toggling using pure HTML and CSS.

## Overview

This challenge required creating a simple, responsive homepage based on the designs provided by DevChallenges. The page includes:

-   A header with navigation links
-   A hero section with a prominent call-to-action

In addition to the basic structure, I added:

-   Animations that trigger when the page loads
-   A theme toggle switch to switch between light and dark modes

## Features

-   **Responsive Design**: The page is fully responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
-   **Load Animations**: Elements animate into view when the page loads, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.
-   **Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark themes using a toggle switch.
